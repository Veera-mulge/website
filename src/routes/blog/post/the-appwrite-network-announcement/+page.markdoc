# The Appwrite Network is now available to everyone

We’re excited to announce that the **Appwrite Network** is now available to **all Appwrite Cloud users**, including those on the Free, Pro, Scale**,** and Enterprise plans.

When we first introduced the Appwrite Network, we laid the foundation for a globally distributed cloud infrastructure designed to improve application performance, availability, and regulatory compliance. Today, we’re extending that foundation to all developers, regardless of plan.

## What is the Appwrite Network?

The Appwrite Network is a global infrastructure of **regions** and **edge locations** that powers your applications with better speed, reliability, and data control. It enables you to:

- Choose where your **project data is stored**, optimizing for both performance and compliance
- Run workloads at **edge locations** to reduce latency and improve responsiveness
- Serve content through a **global CDN** with **integrated DDoS protection**

Whether you're building for local markets or a global user base, the Appwrite Network is designed to deliver a fast and secure experience for your applications.

## Now available to all plans

Previously exclusive to pro users, the Appwrite Network is now available across **free**, **pro**, and **scale** plans. That means every developer using Appwrite Cloud can now deploy in any of the currently available regions:

- **Frankfurt (FRA)** – ready and operational
- **New York City (NYC)** – ready and operational
- **Sydney (SYD)** – ready and operational

More regions are on the way, including Singapore, San Francisco, Bangalore, Amsterdam, London, and Toronto.

## Key benefits of the Appwrite Network

### Low latency worldwide

By routing requests through the closest edge locations, the Appwrite Network significantly reduces response times and improves application performance.

### Data sovereignty and regional compliance

You can choose where your core data lives. This not only improves latency for your target audience but also helps ensure compliance with local data protection regulations.

### Global CDN with integrated security

All Appwrite Cloud projects are served via a built-in global CDN, designed to deliver your content quickly and reliably. Integrated DDoS protection helps detect and mitigate threats without sacrificing performance.

### Optional enterprise-grade WAF

Enterprise customers can also take advantage of Appwrite’s Web Application Firewall (WAF), offering real-time HTTP/HTTPS inspection and customizable rulesets to protect against application-layer attacks.

## Understanding regions, edges, and points of presence

- **Regions** are where your application's core services live, including databases, functions, auth, and storage.
- **Edges** handle compute and request processing closer to your users, ensuring minimal latency and fast interaction.
- **Points of presence (PoPs)** support our CDN, serving cached content from strategic locations around the world.

This layered approach ensures your application is performant, secure, and accessible across the globe.

## What's coming next

We are continuing to invest in building out the Appwrite Network. In the coming months, you can expect new operational regions in:

- **Singapore** (Q4 2025)
- **San Francisco** (Q4 2025)
- **Bangalore, Amsterdam, London, and Toronto** (timeline to be announced)

As the network grows, so will your ability to build fast, reliable, and compliant applications no matter where your users are located.
